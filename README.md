# NOTE: I made the object detection model its weights to detect Man/Women on security cameras

I used a small dataset so the AI isnt as good. the soul test of this model was so that i could share some of my experience
in the object detection model training


# Object Detection Using YOLO

Welcome to my Object Detection Using YOLO 


## Getting Started

To get started with this tutorial, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.

2. Open a command line in the repository folder.

3. Install the required dependencies by running:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook by executing:

```jupyter notebook .```

5. Execute the step-by-step instructions provided in the Jupyter notebooks.

This guide would not be possible without other great tutorials that I used as references:

1. [**OpenCV Object Detection in Games** - Learn Code by Gaming](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1m2M8LQlzfKtkKq2lK5xko4X-8EZzFPI)
    - In this tutorial, you will learn how to use OpenCV for object detection in images using Template matching. It's a great tutorial, very well explained and I highly recommend watching it and also the channel other playlists to learn more about OpenCV.

    - In this tutorial, you can find instructions on running the detector in a live video and also obtaining metrics for your trained model performance. If you want more details about the training process, I recommend reading his Medium article.
